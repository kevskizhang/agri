This is a copy of a project I worked on for my Database Systems class.

A full-stack web application that allows users to create and manage grocery lists, track environmental impact based on product origin, and visualize data on an interactive map.

Built with Next.js 13, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL, the app integrates real-time location services, secure authentication, and a responsive UI.
Features

- Grocery List Management – Create, edit, delete, and organize grocery lists

- Location-Based Tracking – Map integration (Leaflet.js) to estimate environmental impact based on distance

- User Authentication – Secure login/signup flow using JOSE

- Stored Procedures & Transactions – Backend logic with MySQL and Prisma for fuel usage, distance calculation, and item management

- Responsive UI – Mobile-first, accessible interface styled with Tailwind CSS
